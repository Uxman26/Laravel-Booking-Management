    Bear in mind, having a connecting flight through&nbsp;certain countries may involve a transit-visa. Make sure you have sufficient documentation and a visa for transit in those countries that are on your flight to your final destination. Alternatively&nbsp;at&nbsp;bookforvisa.com, you&nbsp;can choose to avoid those countries that require a transit visa. In a&nbsp;flight search, just type in the country or countries you wish to avoid and the search result will be filtered to exclude any flights that are connecting through those countries.</p>
